"""Check Markdown prose against the measurable rules in GUIDE.md.

    uv run --no-project python check.py page.md [page.md ...]   report each page; exit 1 if a hard rule is broken
    uv run --no-project python check.py -v page.md              also show the soft notes, for a person to judge

The checks read prose only: paragraphs, list items and headings. Front matter, code blocks, inline code,
tables, link targets, URLs, image lines, HTML and text in straight double quotes are not checked. Markdown comes first,
and quoted words are examples that the text talks about. A program cannot judge meaning, tone or a missing definition, so read the page too.
